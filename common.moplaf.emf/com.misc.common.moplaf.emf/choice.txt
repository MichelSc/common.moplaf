properties provider

different choices

different usages
  used to display common object in common grid
    add navigation
    one or several set of properties in this sheet
    i want to specify for my sheet the set of properties (1 or several)
    
  columnizer
    one or several set of properties in this sheet
    idem
    is a properties provider
    provides property for the grid
    
  columinzer delegate
    custome columnizer implemented on basis of another PropertiesProvider
    
  aggregation in category
    this is the same
    on top of this, aggregation for the categories
    
 conclusion: I need the provider, but not the sets
