Issues:
  implement partial actions: load for unload and vice versa
  rework keep mechanism: control at any level

Evolutions:
  implement lists
  detect no new solutions
    is this really useful for a no-toy problem?  
  release the current solution
  add traceability features 
  actions: add featues to pinpoint the selected path
