Rework association Resource ScheduledTask
  - side Task.ScheduledResource
      set by procedural logic
  - side Resource.ScheduledTasks
      derived
      sorted
 This way ne do not need to refresh it.
 
 Are there dependencies on the Resource.ScheduledTasks?
   like number of tasks scheduled.
   typically, resource expressions will depend on tasks expressions
   
 Number of tasks scheduled can be maintained.
 
 Do I need the relation Resource.ScheduledTasks? No. 
 
 Implement listening to candidate changes
   - Task.ScheduledTask
   - Task.Next, Previous
   - Expression.CandidateValue
   - Task.ResourceAsFirst, AsLast
   
   Value depends on candidate
     so listen on candidate changes
     refresh value ok
     inbound binding is candidate
     outbound binding is value
     logic is: value = candidate (if candidate modified, value touched)
     reverse logic: candidate = value: reset logic (if candidate modified, value touched)
   
 Implement refresher 
   Candidate = Value
   Value = candidate
