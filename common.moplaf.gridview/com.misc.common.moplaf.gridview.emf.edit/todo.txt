questions
  should the cells have a type (string, numeric )?
  how to publish sorting ?
    one solutions is to public type (string, numeric)
    freeze the sorting: string compare and numeric comparison
  should we make a particular case for the first row/column?
  what about the headers? should we sort them
    sort the row? what criteria?
    sort the columns? what criteria?

say:
  we have
    getCellText
    getCellDouble
    getCellInt
    
say we have
    getCellValue: Object
    getCellType (Double, Int, Boolean, String)
    
we derive comparison from this?
  no, because at cell level, and I want at column/row level
  still compare rows (1 and 2) for some column
    we get 2 cells
    we get 2 types
    and we can possibly compare.
