this is a new idea
  - generic PropagatorActivator
    - added to the Resource (or lower)
    - call the AddFunctionAdapter
    - activate at that time (for the dependencies)
    - do the touchOnOnwned
    - is different from the scope
    - do deactivate when removed from Notifier
    
    
 do we still need a scope?
   - implement the concept of activation: NO
   - do we need it?
     - only for the IsTouchable
     - alternative definition
       - if i am not active, not touchable
       - if my parent is not touchable, not active
       - if i am the root and no resource: no touchable (question)
       - if the resource is loading, not touchable 
     - PropagatorFunctionAdapter has a field isActive
     - condition the touchability of all children
   - we need an entry point for the refresh
     - this is the place where we enter the contentsAdapter
     - this is the scope
     - how to implement it
       - Adapter? 
       - ContentsAdapter? yes
       - quite close to the current implementation
     
     
 so concept of scope disapears
  - the scope is the FPA at the top of the hierarchy
  
for using a plugin supporting propagation
  - add the ContentsAdapter PropagatorFunctionAdapter to the object tree
     - possible places are
        - in the Editor.createModel
           - after the model is loaded (up to date at that time)
           - add it to the resource
     - do the object.addFunctionAdapter = activate
       - call adapter.addPropagatorFunctionAdapters on the newly created propagators
     - do the deactivate/dispose/remove (stops listening)
       - call adpater.disposePropagatorFunctionAdapters();
     - do the on resolve (move the adapters after proxy resolution)
  - call the refresh on ...
